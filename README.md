# Explainations

1. A detailed explanation of the function's purpose and operation.

The function counts the frequency of each unique element in the input argument s(iterable) and returns a dictionary where the keys are the elements and the values are the number of times each element appears.

2. Suggestions for improving the code in terms of efficiency, readability, or functionality.
    a. https://github.com/darkmewtwo/Hamon-Technologies-Code-Challenge/blob/main/count_elements_improvements.py#L5
        Highly readable and very efficient, it is very efficient because the Counter from collections module is used, Counter is specially optimized for the purpose of counting.

    b. https://github.com/darkmewtwo/Hamon-Technologies-Code-Challenge/blob/main/count_elements_improvements.py#L9
        Highly readable and not very efficient as the above, but it is beginner friendly code.

3.  A set of unit tests for this function.
